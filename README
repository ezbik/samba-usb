Before installation make sure all ubuntu desktop automounters are OFF
Insert flash usb drive - nothing must happen - then proceed with installation

Run INSTALL.sh

insert flash usb drive - watch logs in `journalctl -f`, after some time it is mounted under /media/usbX
and exported as LABEL share where LABEL is a name of the filesystem. In this example LABEL=NYNY

 smbclient -I 192.168.135.4  -L 192.168.135.4 
Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Windows 6.1] Server=[Samba 4.7.6-Ubuntu]

    Sharename       Type      Comment
    ---------       ----      -------
    print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
    NYNY            Disk      usb0, ntfs
    IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (sitea-nozt server (Samba, Ubuntu))
Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Windows 6.1] Server=[Samba 4.7.6-Ubuntu]

Then you remove the flash drive and it is unmounted ( can be seen by `df` output  and refreshing smb shares list).
